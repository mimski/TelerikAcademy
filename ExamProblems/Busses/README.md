# Buses

## Description

You know buses and their drivers - they all seem to have different opinion about the speed they move with. That leads to a lot of groups of buses that are grouped together. Since Stamat is a very smart and curious guy, he wants to be able to count the number of groups that are formed from a sequence of buses.

Given the sequence of the speeds of the buses, print on the console the number of groups that are formed.

### Additional notes

- buses cannot outrun buses in front of them
  - If bus **A** is moving faster and reaches a bus **B** that is moving slower, then **A** must lower its speed to match that of **B**
- buses with equal speeds does not form a group
  - Their form different groups

## Example:

## Input

All input data is read from the standard input (the console)

- On the first line will be the number `C`
  - The number of buses
- On the next `C` lines there will a single integer number `S`
  - The speed of the bus

## Output

The output data is printed on the standard output (the console)

- On the single line on the output print the **number of groups** that the buses form

## Constraints

- `C` will always be between `1` and `1000`
- Each `S` will always be between `1` and `1500`
- **The input data will always be correct and there is no need to check it explicitly**
